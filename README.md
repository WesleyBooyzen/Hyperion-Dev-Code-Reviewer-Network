## Why being a code-reviewer?

Since I was a young boy (age from 6 and up), we were taught to keep ourselves busy as to this was the time my parents' divorce were finalised. A computer with the basics (Motherboard, RAM, ROM, CD-ROM, Floppy-ROM and GPU were provided to us as a gift from our uncle.

From there we would find games such as War of Warcraft, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, Command and Conquer, The Sims and Pacific Fighters. At first the games would be quite boring, start of with a given amount of cash, resources and teams. I learned to access the backbone code of the games, rewrite the code so that the game would be more interresting (more troops, more cash, change of sceneries, change details).
