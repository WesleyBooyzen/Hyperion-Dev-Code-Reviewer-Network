Thank you for your submission! Your code is well written, there are a few aspects that we need to address in order for
this task to be marked completed:

Correctness:
Lines 4 to 10 throws an indentation error. Please make the corrections and rerun your code to see if the error still
exists.

Efficiency:
Your code could be improved by simply using an if and else statement, this way the code is more clean and less
runtime errors.
